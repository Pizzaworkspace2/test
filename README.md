**Piecraft 1.14.4 - Development Stage**
-
**💬 Info**:
Hi guys, Pizzaworkspace here, let me introduce you to this new project, Piecraft. It is a minecraft clone built from scratch with HTML, CSS, JS, and Python. PIEthon, get it?
This is different from other minecraft clones because:
- 🌎 Multiplayer
- 💎 Modern versions of Minecraft
- 🚀 Comes with a launcher
-    Skins and capes 
- 🎨 Tons of HTML and JS code.

**Gonna try to use three.js for a 3d rendered clone, but IDK if it will work.**
